# Problem Statement: "Often I have to search for different files and directories within my computer system. 
#                     In order to do this I use the 'ls' command to help orient myself.
# Name of command: ls
# Example of its usage: 
# -bash-4.2$ ls
# Lab1  README.md

# Here is the myScript.sh script that can list the directories and how many total directories are in the current folder.
# usage: sh myScript.sh
